## 🔧 TECHNICAL LOG

### Incident Report
```
Error: digest mismatch, file must be downloaded again
Want: sha256:6c02683809a8dc4eb05c78d44bc63bcd707703b078998fa58829c858ab337bb0

## 👨‍🚀 COMMANDER'S NOTES

### Pre-Contact Observations

**The Journey So Far:**
- ✅ Vessel stabilized after critical systems failure
- ✅ Autoheal reformed (no longer rogue)
- ✅ The Brain operational (CPU inference mode)
- ✅ Black Box synchronized (all fixes permanent)
- ✅ The Vibe established (Operator's Handbook deployed)
- ⏳ The Synapse forming (network issues encountered)
- ⏳ The Library loading (80% complete - 72GB/90GB)
- ⏸️ The Crew awaiting (cryo-sleep)

### Resilience Notes

*"Even in the void of deep space, when downloads corrupt and networks fail, the Nomad Node perseveres. We detect. We repair. We continue. This is the way."*

**Quality of Transmission:** TBD  
**Speed of Thought:** TBD  
**Next Directive:** TBD

## 🎯 LESSONS LEARNED (Pre-Contact)

1. **Network Re-Supply is Fragile** - The Void (Internet) is unreliable even when available
2. **Verification Matters** - SHA256 digests catch corruption before deployment
3. **Automated Recovery** - Ollama's digest verification prevented corrupted neural pathways
4. **Patience in Deep Space** - Large downloads take time, errors happen, we persist

---

## 📊 CURRENT VESSEL STATUS

**Hull Integrity:** 15/16 modules operational (94%)  
**The Brain:** OPERATIONAL (awaiting neural enhancement)  
**The Synapse:** RECONSTRUCTING (ETA ~10min)  
**The Library:** INGESTING (80% complete)  
**The Crew:** CRYO-SLEEP (ready to wake)

             "We wait. We prepare. We do not rush."
             
            The moment will come. The Crew will wake.
              The vessel will speak its first words.
