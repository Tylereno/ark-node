Dear [Name],

I'm reaching out regarding potential research collaboration on autonomous edge computing systems for high-entropy environments.

**The Problem:**
Modern industrial operational technology (OT) assumes infinite power and bandwidth—an assumption that fails in remote extraction sites, subsurface operations, and aerospace analogs. When connectivity is severed, operations halt, data is lost, and safety systems degrade.

**The Solution:**
I've developed ARK (Autonomous Resilient Kernel), a sovereign infrastructure stack that eliminates this fragility. ARK uses hardware-watchdog architectures to detect failures and automate recovery without human intervention, even during extended network outages or power constraints.

**Validation:**
The system is currently v3.1.0 stable and has been field-validated via Mobile Node Alpha, a terrestrial analog platform subjected to real-world vibration, thermal cycling, and solar intermittency. Results: 99.9% data retention during 72+ hour network outages, < 60 second recovery time from power cycles.

**Research Question:**
How can autonomous edge systems safely coordinate industrial processes when disconnected for days or weeks at a time? This intersects with:
- Resilient computing architectures
- Edge autonomy and decision-making
- Industrial OT security in denied environments
- Power-aware orchestration

**Why SLAC:**
SLAC's work on [RESEARCH AREA - customize based on their website] aligns with the challenges ARK addresses. I'm particularly interested in [SPECIFIC LAB/GROUP] and how autonomous edge systems could support [SPECIFIC APPLICATION - e.g., particle detector control systems, remote monitoring, etc.].

I've attached the full Concept of Operations document for your review. I'd welcome the opportunity to discuss potential collaboration or research opportunities.

## Alternative: Shorter Version

If you want a more concise version:

```
Dear [Name],

I'm an industrial systems architect working on autonomous edge computing for high-entropy environments. I've developed ARK, a sovereign infrastructure stack that maintains operational continuity during extended network outages or power constraints.

ARK uses hardware-watchdog architectures to automate recovery without human intervention. It's currently v3.1.0 stable and field-validated via a mobile terrestrial analog node.

I'm interested in SLAC's work on [RESEARCH AREA] and how autonomous edge systems could support [APPLICATION]. I've attached the Concept of Operations document for your review.

Would you be available for a brief call to discuss potential research collaboration?

Best,
Tyler Eno

## Follow-Up Strategy

**If No Response (After 2 Weeks):**
```
Subject: Re: Autonomous Edge Computing - Follow-Up

Hi [Name],

Following up on my previous email about ARK and autonomous edge computing for high-entropy environments.

I understand you're likely busy, but I wanted to highlight one specific application that might be relevant: [SPECIFIC USE CASE based on their research].

I've attached the CONOPS document again for easy reference. If this isn't the right fit, I'd appreciate any suggestions for other researchers at SLAC who might be interested.

Best,
Tyler Eno
```

**If Positive Response:**
- Schedule a 30-minute call
- Prepare a 5-slide technical overview
- Have specific collaboration ideas ready
- Be ready to discuss research questions, not just your project

## Key Success Factors

1. **Specificity:** Reference their actual research, not generic "SLAC work"
2. **Value Proposition:** Focus on what you can contribute, not what you want
3. **Technical Credibility:** The CONOPS document does the heavy lifting
4. **Collaboration Mindset:** Frame as partnership, not job application

---

**Remember:** National Labs value research collaboration and technical depth. The CONOPS document demonstrates both. Your job is to get them to read it.
