# ARK Node v3.1.2: Industrial Edition (LTS)

**Status:** STABLE / LONG TERM SUPPORT  
**Codename:** "Ironclad"  
**Release Date:** 2024-01-16

---

## 🚀 Overview

v3.1.2 marks the transition from "Experimental" to "Industrial" grade. This release focuses on autonomous resilience and sovereign connectivity. It introduces a self-correcting container mesh that detects service degradation and repairs it without human intervention—critical for deployments in intermittent power/network environments (e.g., Mobile Command Units, Mining Operations, Off-Grid Assets).

---

## 🛡️ Key Features

### Self-Healing Mesh
Integrated autoheal daemon now actively monitors service heartbeats. If a critical subsystem (Traefik, Portainer) hangs, the kernel automatically restarts it.

### Tailscale First
"Host Validation" logic updated to natively trust Tailscale mesh IPs (100.x.x.x), ensuring remote telemetry remains accessible even when local DNS is compromised.

### Version Pinning
Core infrastructure images locked to stable hashes to prevent upstream drift during field operations.

## 🔧 Changelog

- **[Security]** Patched HOMEPAGE_ALLOWED_HOSTS to permit secure Tailscale ingress.
- **[Resilience]** Added willfarrell/autoheal watchdog service.
- **[Resilience]** Implemented native HEALTHCHECK probes for Traefik and Dashboard services.
