## Charter Alignment

From PROJECT_CHARTER.md:

v1.0 ✅ Complete
v1.1 Goals (Q1 2026):
- ⏳ Improved setup wizards - NOT STARTED
- ⏳ Kiwix download helper - NOT STARTED
- ⏳ Automated backup - NOT STARTED

## Priority Action Items

### CRITICAL (Next 7 Days)
1. Create download-wikipedia.sh script
2. Create download-survival-guides.sh script
3. Create download-maps.sh script
4. Test all automation

### HIGH (Next 30 Days)
5. Build install wizard (PowerShell + Bash)
6. Deploy minimal content (Wikipedia + guides)
7. Update docs to match reality

## Gap Analysis

**Charter Promises:**
- Offline Wikipedia ← 0% deployed
- Offline Maps ← 0% deployed
- Survival Guides ← 0% deployed (mentioned in docs)
- Go-Bag ($99-$149) ← Blocked by content
- Easy installation ← No wizard yet

**Estimated Work to v1.1:** 40-60 hours

## Bottom Line

✅ **Infrastructure:** Rock solid  
❌ **Content:** Empty (need download scripts!)  
❌ **Installation:** Manual (need wizard!)

**User is 100% correct:** We need easy install scripts!

Next: Build content download automation.
