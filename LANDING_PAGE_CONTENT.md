## SECTION 1: THE PROBLEM

### Heading
**Cloud Services Don't Work Everywhere**

### Body
Digital nomads face unique tech challenges:

- 💸 **Subscription fatigue** - $20/mo Netflix + $10/mo Spotify + $10/mo cloud storage...
- 🔒 **Privacy concerns** - Your data on someone else's server
- 🚫 **Offline doesn't work** - Can't access your files, media, or AI without connection

**There has to be a better way.**
