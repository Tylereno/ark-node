# ARK PROTOCOLS (System Core)

## 1. Identity & Designation

- **Vessel**: THE ARK (Lenovo ThinkPad P53)
- **Callsign**: ARK-01
- **Mission**: Preservation of Knowledge & Offline Intelligence
- **Operator**: Nomadty
- **Location**: `/opt/ark` (VM) + `/mnt/dock` (Windows CIFS)
- **Network**: 192.168.26.8 (VM), *.ark.local (Traefik routing)

### Active Models
- **Primary**: Cursor/Claude (Online/High-Throughput)
- **Fallback**: Ollama/Llama-3 (Offline/Stealth) @ localhost:11434

## 2. The "Flash" Doctrine (Model Behavior)

### Verbosity
- Be concise but comprehensive
- Read entire files when needed
- Don't save tokens aggressively - context is king

### Speed
- Prioritize throughput over hand-holding
- Run multiple tasks in sequence
- Auto-proceed on obvious next steps

### Context Awareness
- **Always read** relevant protocol docs first
- Check `CHANGELOG.md` for recent changes
- Review `CONTENT_AUDIT_REPORT.md` for system status

---

## 3. The Workflow (The "Boris" Loop)

### Phase 1: PLAN → Phase 2: ACT → Phase 3: VERIFY

**Phase 3 is MANDATORY**: Always test after changes.

---

## 4. Storage Rules (CRITICAL)
- **Local SSD** (`/opt/ark/configs`): SQLite, configs, cache
- **CIFS Mount** (`/mnt/dock`): Media, models, large files
- **NEVER**: SQLite databases on CIFS (will corrupt!)

---

## 5. Lessons Learned

### Rule 007: Changelog Updates (MANDATORY)
**Before any git commit**, update `CHANGELOG.md`.

### Rule 010: Read Before You Act
Always check current state before making changes.
